#### Homework 2 - Time-Delay Neural Networks vs Recurrent Neural Networks

Using the attached sequential data, you are going to train a time-delay neural networks and LSTM-RNN and compare their results.

Use first 70% of the data for training and rest for testing.
Optimize the hyper-parameters by applying cross-validation procedure on the training set.

The plots and results that will be generated in this homework:
1) Plot of the original dataset.
2) Plot of mean squared error of LSTM-RNN with changing timestep on test set.
3) Plot of mean squared error of MLP with changing timestep on test set.
4) Plot of the predictions of best MLP and LSTM-RNNs models along with the actual values of training set.
5) Plot of the predictions of best MLP and LSTM-RNNs models along with the actual values of test set.
6) Table including the Mean Squared Error and Mean Absolute error for both training and test sets.

#### Submit a single text document including the following
a) results (plots and table),

b) a short report explaining about the hyper-parameter optimization procedure
and the details about the architectures you used in your experiments.

c) discussions (discuss the results in a comparative manner),

d) source code.

#### Instructions

Use any ANN library for multilayer perceptron and LSTM-RNNs.
